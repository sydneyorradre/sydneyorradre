                                <p>
                                    There's a growing movement within modern Paganism known as kitchen witchery. The kitchen is, after all, the heart and hearth of many modern households. When you have a gathering in your home, where do most of your guests hang out? Why, the kitchen, of course! Also, thanks to a declining economy, many more people are making meals from scratch and the kitchen has once again become a place where people spend hours, rather than minutes. So it's no surprise that kitchen witchery has seen a rise in popularity.

                                    You don’t have to identify as a “witch” to do witchcraft. Spoon Univeristy discusses more about the history and how you can begin to get ready for spellwork and manifestation. Sometimes, setting your intention is all the magic you need (well, to start with anyway).
