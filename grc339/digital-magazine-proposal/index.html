            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <h3>Sacred Stone</h3>
            
            <p>“Sacred Stone” is a guide for the modern day witch. Our audience is women in the age range 18-34. From providing historical context to common day witchcraft (such as lighting sage to cleanse one’s space) to tarot deck reviews, “Sacred Stone” is a foundational source of information to those interested in witchcraft, acting as an introduction to the occult and dark whimsy. “Sacred Stone” got its name because of the use of crystals as a fundamental characteristic to witchcraft, including but not limited to spellwork, psychic readings, and rituals.</p>

	<p>In the wake of a new age spirituality, creators Gold and Sydney, wanted to provide a source of information that is readily accessible to anyone and everyone so they created a digital magazine. “Sacred Stone” will showcase history and modern media involving witchcraft and/or anything considered as witchcraft by the masses. It uses themes of humor to enlighten readers about more of the history that is often overlooked as people begin their spiritual journeys.</p>
